#### A)
_Open/closed principle_  
software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification  

Building on the definition above, the Area function respects the open/closed principle due to the fact that it is abstracted in a way that accepts any kind of shapes, no matter what the specifities of the shapes are. Area can thus be extended without modification (open for extension) if a new defined-shape class (circle, triangle, rectangle, etc) is needed in the program.

It would not respect the open/closed principle if it would have to be modified each time a new kind of shape enters the program, such as if the function below:

```
public double Area(object[] shapes)
{
    double area = 0;
    foreach (var shape in shapes)
    {
        if (shape is Rectangle)
        {
            Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;
            area += rectangle.Width-rectangle.Height;
        }
        else
        {
            Circle circle = (Circle)shape;
            area += circle.Radius - circle.Radius - Math.PI;
        }
    }

    return area;
}  
```  

In the example above, the function Area would have to be modified each time a new kind of shape enters the program (ex: triangles).

#### B)

see `q3b.js` and considerations below:

CONSIDERATIONS  
 - keep the serializer private  
 - give meaningful names to method arguments and variable names  
 - indent properly  
 - space properly  
 - eliminate unncessary statements (ex: return;)  
 - handle potential errors, but here I feel there is no exception to add, as they should be handled by the methods of the response Object, and serializer object  
 - use JSON.stringify as the default toString method because better than toString in js for the current purpose (we would however need to check for function types, object holding functions,  or undefined types and handle them appropriately (use toString before using JSON.stringify on functions, and convert undefined to an empty string for example)  

QUESTIONS   
 - could the open/closed principle could be useful here? so we could only write   ```
 response.getWriter().write(SERIALIZE.write(rawBodyContent, responseContentType)) 
```  
without a loop or switch statement. 

 - What are some other patterns we could have utilized here?
