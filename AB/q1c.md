As in Test-Driven Development by Example by Kent Beck

The TDD lifecycle can be quickly summed up as follows:

1. Quickly add a test
2. Run all tests and see the new one fail  
3. Make a little change  
4. Run all tests and see them all succeed  
5. Refactor to remove duplication

Points 4 and 5 should be discussed. These could also be named 4) Make it run, and 5) Make it right. Point 4 makes sure you think about making your program running properly as fast as possible, whereas point 5 makes sure you preserve software development best practices and keep your code clean as the software keeps getting bigger and bigger.
