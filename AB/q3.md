#### A)
_Open/closed principle_  
software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification  

Building on the definition above, the Area function respects the open/closed principle due to the fact that it is abstracted in a way that accepts any kind of shapes, no matter what the specifities of the shapes are. Area can thus be extended without modification (open for extension) if a new defined-shape class (circle, triangle, rectangle, etc) is needed in the program.

It would not respect the open/closed principle if it would have to be modified each time a new kind of shape enters the program, such as if the function below:

```
public double Area(object[] shapes)
{
    double area = 0;
    foreach (var shape in shapes)
    {
        if (shape is Rectangle)
        {
            Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;
            area += rectangle.Width*rectangle.Height;
        }
        else
        {
            Circle circle = (Circle)shape;
            area += circle.Radius * circle.Radius * Math.PI;
        }
    }

    return area;
}  
```  

In the example below, the function Area would have to be modified each time a new kind of shape enters the program (ex: triangles).
