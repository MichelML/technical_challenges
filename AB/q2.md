Disclaimer: I am new to this and it is still pretty abstract for me. I have used git in the past, but only on personal projects.

### a)
[Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing). Assuming we have already done `git checkout branch`.  

```
git rebase master
```

### b)  
[Revert](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert). Assuming we have already done `git checkout branch`.  
 
``` 
git revert -m 1 (Commit id of the merge commit)
```
The `1` can vary depending on which merge commit parent we want to revert. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7099833/how-to-revert-a-merge-commit-thats-already-pushed-to-remote-branch/7100005#7100005) for more context.

### c)
Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch to another branch, but [they do it in different ways](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

Merge ties together the histories of two branches, while leaving the two branches unchanged. Rebase re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch (the branch from which the rebase is done) to the target branch. 

Merge is usually a [non-destructive operation](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/conceptual-overview)</sup> leaving the two branches unchanged after execution, but it can pollute a feature's branch history if, for example, it needs to be kept up to date with a very active master branch (repetitive upstream changes). It can be hard to understand what has been accomplished inside the feature branch after a long period of work in this context. Another way to put it is if the need to merge arises simply because multiple people are working on the same branch in parallel, the merges donâ€™t serve any useful historic purpose and create more of a history mess instead <sup>[[source]](https://blog.sourcetreeapp.com/2012/08/21/merge-or-rebase/)</sup>.

The [golden rule](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/the-golden-rule-of-rebasing) of rebasing is to never use it on public branches. For example, if you were to rebase master on a feature branch you are working on, this would move all the commits  in master onto the tip of your feature branch, but __only  in your repository__. All the other developers would be however working on the original master branch (we have now two 'version' of master branch), and that can generate further problems when the two version of master branch will have to be merged back together in the future.
