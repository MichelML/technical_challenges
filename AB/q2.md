### a)
Assuming we have already checkout to `branch`.  

```
git rebase master
```

### b)  
Assuming we have already checkout to `branch`.  

 
``` 
git revert -m 1 (Commit id of the merge commit)
```
The `1` can vary depending on which merge parents we want to 'revert to'. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7099833/how-to-revert-a-merge-commit-thats-already-pushed-to-remote-branch/7100005#7100005) for more context.

### c)
Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch to another branch, but [they do it in different ways](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

Merge ties together the histories of two branches. Merge is usually a non-destructive operation leaving the two branches unchanged, but it can pollute a feature's branch history if it needs to be kept up to date with a very active master branch (repetitive upstream changes). It can be hard to understand what has been accomplished inside the feature branch after a long period of work in this context.

Rebase re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch (the branch from which the rebase is done).
