### a)
[Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing). Assuming we have already done `git checkout branch`.  

```
git rebase master
```

### b)  
[Revert](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert). Assuming we have already done `git checkout branch`.  
 
``` 
git revert -m 1 (Commit id of the merge commit)
```
The `1` can vary depending on which merge commit parent we want to revert. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7099833/how-to-revert-a-merge-commit-thats-already-pushed-to-remote-branch/7100005#7100005) for more context.

### c)
Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch to another branch, but [they do it in different ways](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

Merge ties together the histories of two branches, while leaving the two branches unchanged. Rebase re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch (the branch from which the rebase is done) to the target branch. 

Merge is usually a non-destructive operation <sup>[[source]](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/conceptual-overview)</sup> leaving the two branches unchanged after execution, but it can pollute a feature's branch history if, for example, it needs to be kept up to date with a very active master branch (repetitive upstream changes). It can be hard to understand what has been accomplished inside the feature branch after a long period of work in this context. Another way to put it is if the need to merge arises simply because multiple people are working on the same branch in parallel, the merges donâ€™t serve any useful historic purpose and create more of a history mess instead <sup>[[source]](https://blog.sourcetreeapp.com/2012/08/21/merge-or-rebase/)</sup>.
