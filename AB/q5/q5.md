### [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Manifesto_for_Agile_Software_Development) 

Agile describes a set of principles for software development favoring the decentralized decision-making process regarding a [software] project or product, which in practice is supposed to translate in the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. As specified by its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), it advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

#### Core Values
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

#### Principles
1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
3. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7. Working software is the principal measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

### [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_\(software_development\))
Scrum is an [agile] framework among others of the agile family. It provides its own interpretation of the agile concept through the specification of concrete guidelines, roles, terminology, and orientations to implement the agile principles within development teams. 

#### [Scrum terminology](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Newbies-Amazingly-management-development-ebook/dp/B015QA141W)

- Burn down charts
  - show the amount of work remaining. Y-axis indicates remaining work and X-axis indicates time required to complete the work.
- Daily Scrum meeting
  - 15 minutes meeting happening daily to make sure the project and everyone on the team is on track and productive.
- Scrum master
  - makes sure everyone follows the basic Scrum procedure
- Impediments
  - Anything that hinders team members in the performance and accomplishment of their duties.
- Product backlog
  - Project requirements. Constaly changing and evolving documents as the project advances.
- Product backlog item (PBI)
  - Small section of work that should be completed by the team in a single sprint session.
- Product backlog item effort
  - Days it will take to complete a PBI or a small part of the product backlog
- Product Burn-Down Chart
  - Big picture chart showing the progress of a project.
- Product Owner Role
  - Responsible for maximizing the product's value. Represents the customer interests and is the final authority in terms of requirements and prioritization.
- Release
  - Product moves from the Scrum team into use by customers.
- Release burndown chart
  - Shows release progress.
- Sprint
  - A window of time from 2 weeks to a month, during which the dev team creates a product increment (improve software functionality).
- Sprint backlog
  - Work to be done during a specific sprint.
- Sprint Burn Down Chart
  - Shows progress toward sprint goals.
- Sprint Goals
  - Set of goals a team can meet by implementing items from project backlog.
- Sprint Planning Meeting
  - Where everyones decide the work to be done during the next sprint.
- Sprint retrospective meeting
  - Consider improvements and plans for implementing them after a sprint is completed.
- Sprint task
  - a section of work between four to sixteen hours
- Development team
  - The ones who actually do the work of getting product backlog items done.
- Scrum team (development team + product owner + scrum master)
  - dev team + scrum-specific roles
- Team member
  - I'll let you guess this one :D
- Velocity
  - the amount of product backlog a team handles in a single sprint
  - it can be utilized in planning projects and forecasting the completion dates of products
